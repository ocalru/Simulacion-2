Frequentists define probability based on the frequency of events in repeated measurements, viewing parameters as fixed and immutable. In contrast, Bayesians interpret probability as a measure of belief or certainty regarding an unknown parameter, allowing for the estimation of probabilities based on prior knowledge and data.\n","\n","The paper aims to bridge the philosophical and practical gaps between these approaches, particularly for scientists who may lack a deep understanding of their implications for data analysis. It emphasizes that while the discussion will lean more towards Bayesian methods, it does not serve as a comprehensive introduction to either approach.\n","\n","Through illustrative examples implemented in Python, the paper aims to clarify how these philosophical differences manifest in statistical practices, affecting both computation and the interpretation of results. The author intends to equip researchers with a better understanding of the tools at their disposal, ultimately enhancing their ability to conduct and interpret statistical analyses in their fields.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dFyj8-_MeC2-"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"3MnoCdnFeGhj"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
